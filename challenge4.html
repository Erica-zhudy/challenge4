    <p>The mario pizza with rosemary fries was exceptional. Served with a side of garden salad and diet coke, this meal is a perfect way to kick back on a Friday or a weekend. This is actually a regular restaurant that I frequent when I am in town. Scaddabush Mississauga has an upscale feeling while serving authentic italian food with a North American flare. You can definitely taste the difference that their high-quality ingredients make. I love that Scaddanush uses different herbs to add some spice to their dishes, whether it’s rosemary on the fries or using mildly spicy pepperoni, the food is exquisite. The mario pizza is a perfect blend of delicate prosciutto on a bed of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese topped with fresh arugula. Scaddabush is a must for any local or visitor in town!</p>

        <p>Iruka Sushi is a must visit when in Toronto. The perfect quiet restaurant allows you to enjoy a delicate and delicious Japanese meal. The best part? You can go for a walk along the lake right after. The chicken katsu is a must-try from me. With its perfectly crispy pieces served with a special sweet Iruka sauce, the first bite is magnificent. This is a very small restaurant with limited seating capacity but they are always busy with customers. It seems like the locals are very loyal to this spot. With modern Japanese decor, I love to sit and enjoy their jasmine tea while watching people run along the lake or walk their dogs. They are on all major food delivery apps so they are accessible even if all you want to do that day is to step outside your door to get your package. Don’t miss this great spot!</p>

   <p>The daily special Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo is one of the tastiest fettuccine I’ve ever had. Served with garlic bread and I savoured every bit. The staff is very friendly and it is a cosy place at the heart of Downtown Kitchener. The freshly made fettuccine was cooked to perfection and the wine selection was amazing! Everytime time I’m in Kitchener, I gotta eat there. Oh, and the price is really affordable, value for money. I would highly recommend trying their food when you are in downtown!!</p>
